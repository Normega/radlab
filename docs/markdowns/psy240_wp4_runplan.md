# PSY240 WP4 — the content sprint run plan

> Written 2026-07-30, **corrected the same day against the actual book** (the first draft
> guessed the module numbering and got it wrong — see §1). Keyed to the live catalogue in
> `radlab-academic` rather than to any doc. Companion to
> [`psy240_wiki_plan.md`](./psy240_wiki_plan.md) (§4 sequencing) and
> [`psy240_taxonomy.md`](./psy240_taxonomy.md) (§6, the page list).
>
> **Scope: 78 generated pages, ~17 instructor-hours.** 53 Tier A disorders + 16 topic
> overviews + 9 foundations. The 45 Tier B stubs are generated mechanically from the seed
> with no model call and are not part of this plan.

## 0. Read this first — two things that will bite

**Run sequentially, never in parallel, and never the same source twice *in paper mode*.**
Filenames are unstable run-to-run, so two concurrent ingests of overlapping material produce two
competing carves of the same concepts. One job at a time, each seeing the wiki the previous one
left. **Reference mode is the exception**: it names its target, so running the same module against
several different catalogue pages is the intended pattern, not a violation — `reference_worklist`
counts prior runs per page for exactly that reason.

**Triage between runs, or you get duplicates.** `api/ingest.js` builds the model's wiki index
from pages **with accepted content only** — a page sitting unreviewed is invisible to the next
run, so the next module proposes it afresh as a full draft. That is deliberate (two competing
full drafts is reviewable; a delta against nothing is not), but it makes the loop:

> run a module → skim its proposals → **accept as draft** anything structurally sound, reject
> the junk → run the next module

Triage is ~5 minutes and is *not* the review. It exists to get pages into the index. The real
review (~17 h) happens afterwards, page by page in the reader, where `edit_page` lets you fix
in place instead of round-tripping through the queue. Nothing is published by triage, so no
student sees a drafted page.

## 1. The book, as it actually is

`Fundamentals-of-Psychological-Disorders-1721254433._oss.pdf`, 343 pages, **16 modules** in six
parts. All 16 are now split out in `F:\gits\Handbook\Resources\` as
`BridleyDaffin-ModuleNN-Title.pdf`, using the same boundaries and naming as the two you had
already extracted — verified by reproducing Module 04 (23 pages) and Module 07 (18 pages)
byte-for-page against your own files.

| Module | Title | Book pages | Pages |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | What is Abnormal Psychology? | 30–63 | 34 |
| 02 | Models of Abnormal Psychology | 64–98 | 35 |
| 03 | Clinical Assessment, Diagnosis, and Treatment | 99–114 | 16 |
| 04 | Mood Disorders | 116–138 | 23 |
| 05 | Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders | 139–155 | 17 |
| 06 | Dissociative Disorders | 156–167 | 12 |
| 07 | Anxiety Disorders | 169–186 | 18 |
| 08 | Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders | 187–201 | 15 |
| 09 | Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders | 202–215 | 14 |
| 10 | Feeding and Eating Disorders | 217–231 | 15 |
| 11 | Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders | 232–250 | 19 |
| 12 | Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders | 252–267 | 16 |
| 13 | Personality Disorders | 268–287 | 20 |
| 14 | Neurocognitive Disorders | 289–301 | 13 |
| 15 | Contemporary Issues in Psychopathology | 302–310 | 9 |
| 16 | Disorders of Childhood Overview | 311–340 | 30 |

**Do not assume module number tracks DSM chapter number.** The first draft of this plan did,
on the strength of Module 4 = Mood, and was wrong: the book groups disorders into teaching
*blocks*, not DSM order. Anxiety is Module **7**, not 5; OCD is **9**, not 6; somatic is **8**,
not 9. The mapping below is from the book's own table of contents.

## 3. The run order

Ordered by **lecture**, so partial completion is still usable — if August compresses you want
weeks 1–4 finished, not a random half of the course.

| # | Upload | Mode | Produces | Lec |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Module 01 | **reference** ×3 → `what-is-abnormal`, `historical-traditions`, `research-methods` | L1 |
| 2 | Module 02 | **reference** ×2 → `models-of-psychopathology`, `integrative-model` | L1–2 |
| 3 | Module 03 | **reference** ×2 → `clinical-assessment`, `diagnosis-and-classification` | L2 |
| 4 | Module 15 | **reference** ×1 → `law-and-ethics` | L1/L10 |
| 5 | Module 07 | paper | 4 Tier A + anxiety overview (1 already written) | L3 |
| 6 | Module 09 | paper | 2 Tier A + OCD overview | L3 |
| 7 | Module 08 | paper | 3 Tier A + somatic overview (1 written) | L3 |
| 8 | Module 05 | paper | 2 Tier A + trauma overview | L4 |
| 9 | Module 06 | paper | 2 Tier A + dissociative overview | L4 |
| — | ~~Module 04~~ | paper ✔ | **already run** — 7 pages | L5 |
| 10 | Module 10 | paper | 3 Tier A + eating overview (2 written) | L6 |
| 11 | Module 11 | paper | 5 Tier A + substance overview | L8 |
| 12 | Module 12 | paper | 2 Tier A + schizophrenia overview | L9 |
| 13 | Module 14 | paper | 3 Tier A + neurocognitive overview | L10 |
| 14 | Module 13 | paper | **10 Tier A** + personality overview (1 written) | L11 |
| 15 | **Module 16 — run this LAST** | paper | neurodevelopmental + disruptive/conduct, and deltas onto pages from runs 5–10 | L3/8/10 |

### Why the foundations runs are reference mode, not paper

**Learned the hard way on 2026-07-31**, when Module 01 was run in paper mode as the first draft
of this plan said. It produced six genuinely good pages — `stigma-of-mental-illness`,
`medicalization-of-distress`, `epidemiology`, `multicultural-psychology` — and **none of the
catalogue foundations it was supposed to fill.** The module has sections on the history of mental
illness and on research methods; no page was made for either. It wrote `abnormal-behavior` where
the catalogue says `what-is-abnormal`.

The reason generalises, so it is worth stating: **the slug convention holds for disorders because
disorder names are canonical.** The field agrees what "major depressive disorder" is called, so the
model's independent choice and the catalogue's hand-written slug converge — which is exactly what
was measured and celebrated at 44 pages. **Foundations slugs are our invention.** There is nothing
for the model to converge on, so paper mode will keep missing them however many times it is run.

Anything with a catalogue slug the field would not independently invent — foundations, and the 16
topic overviews — wants reference mode, which names the target. Paper mode is for letting a source
tell you what it contains.

Paper-mode runs on the foundations modules are still *useful* — that is where the supporting
concept pages come from — so the shape is: reference runs for the named pages, and optionally one
paper run per module afterwards for the surrounding concepts.

**Module 16 goes last, deliberately.** It cross-cuts: it covers selective mutism and separation
anxiety (anxiety), trichotillomania and excoriation (OCD), reactive attachment (trauma), pica and
ARFID (eating), as well as its own neurodevelopmental and conduct material. Run early it would
*define* those pages from a childhood-overview angle; run last it writes **updates onto pages the
proper chapter module already established**, which is the right shape. It is also the run most
likely to produce many small deltas — expect a fuller triage pass than the others.

Run 14 (personality) is the heaviest single run: all ten PDs became Tier A on 2026-07-30, so one
module carries ten full pages. Consider splitting its review across two sittings.

---

## 4. What the textbook does not cover

Verified against the book's table of contents — **all of Lecture 7 plus sleep has no module**:

| DSM ch | Topic | Lecture | Tier A | Overview |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12 | Sleep-wake | L6 | 2 | 1 |
| 13 | Sexual dysfunctions | L7 | 2 | 1 |
| 14 | Gender dysphoria | L7 | 1 | — |
| 19 | Paraphilic disorders | L7 | 2 | 1 |

That's **7 Tier A pages and 3 overviews with no textbook source** — the single biggest finding in
this plan, and worth knowing in July rather than in week six. The 9th foundations page,
**suicide**, is also uncovered: it appears inside Module 04's mood epidemiology but has no section
of its own.

Use **reference mode** for all of these — it names the target page from the catalogue, so you get
the page the course needs rather than whatever carve a source suggests. Sources:

| Source | Licence | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| NIMH health topics & statistics | US public domain — copyable with citation | prevalence, onset, course, suicide statistics, plain-language framing |
| ICD-11 CDDR | WHO open licence | criteria structure, boundaries with normality and with other disorders |
| StatPearls (NCBI) | CC BY-NC-**ND** | read, cite, paraphrase — **never remix the text** |
| Cochrane / NICE / CANMAT | free to read | treatment evidence, effect sizes, Canadian relevance |

**L7 needs the most care of any lecture**: it has no textbook source *and* contains both pages the
taxonomy flagged for **rewrite-level review at ~30 min each** — gender dysphoria (dated
terminology in the source deck) and the paraphilic overview (lecture-hall-provocative framing).
Those flags surface automatically as a red banner in the review queue.

**DSM-5-TR PDFs never enter the pipeline.** Pages link the official chapter through the myaccess
proxy; they never carry criteria text.

---

## 5. After the module sweep: the reference pass

`reference_worklist` orders incomplete catalogue pages Tier A first, by state and gap count. As of
2026-07-30 that list is trustworthy — gaps derive from the page body, so a page that says it needs
etiology really does.

For each Tier A page still declaring gaps, run reference mode against a second source naming that
page as the target. Since 2026-07-30 reference mode returns a **complete page with `action:
replace`** rather than a delta, so accepting overwrites cleanly and you get one coherent voice
instead of two stitched together.

### What repeat runs on one source cost

Every run re-sends the whole document, so three reference runs against one module read that module
three times. Measured on the two real runs:

| Run | Mode | Input tokens | Output | Pages |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Module 04, paper | extracted | 24,938 | 16,468 | 18 |
| Module 04, reference | extracted | 26,090 | 4,372 | 1 |
| Module 01, paper | **native** | **91,863** | 8,970 | 6 |

**Native costs ~3.7× the input of extracted on this book.** Native is the course default because
*student* submissions may be scans with no text layer — that reasoning does not apply to this
textbook, which is born-digital with a clean text layer, and Module 04 produced 18 good pages in
extracted mode.

The trade-off is real though: extraction silently drops figures and mangles tables. For the
foundations modules (prose and concepts) extracted is a safe saving. For the **disorder chapters,
stay native** — the criteria and prevalence tables are the payload, and a mangled table looks like
a successful run.

**Prompt caching was investigated (2026-07-31) and is not worth it here.** The arithmetic, on
Module 01's real 91,863 input tokens at Opus 4.8's $5/MTok: three reference runs cost **$1.38**
uncached, **$1.01** with a 1-hour cache — a 27% saving, about **$0.37 per module**. Two things
kill it. Caching only breaks even at **three or more runs against the same PDF**, and only Module
01 has three targets (02 and 03 have two, Module 15 has one — for those, caching costs *more*
than not caching). And a **5-minute TTL is actively worse than no caching** in this workflow:
triage sits between runs, so each run would write a cache the next run is too late to read —
3 × 1.25× = 3.75× versus 3× for doing nothing. Meanwhile switching those same runs to extracted
mode costs nothing to implement and brings three runs to about **$0.38**, beating every cached
variant of the native path.

One structural note worth keeping, because it is non-obvious and would otherwise be rediscovered:
`api/ingest.js` already puts the PDF **before** the volatile text (target brief + wiki index) in
the user message, and the wiki index changes between runs as pages are accepted. That ordering —
done for an unrelated reason — is exactly what caching needs, so if the economics ever change,
enabling it is a one-line `cache_control` on the document block with **no prompt reordering**. The
token accounting already sums `input + cache_creation + cache_read`, so recorded job totals would
stay comparable.

## 6. Citations — copy these, don't compose them

Attribution is a **licence condition** for CC BY-NC-SA material, not a courtesy. Page attribution
derives from `ingest_jobs.source_citation` (`wiki_page_provenance`), so the string you paste at
upload is the one a reader eventually sees under *Built from*.

**The form.** Creative Commons attribution wants four things — title, author, source, licence
(TASL). The original Module 4 citation had the first two and named the licence but gave **no link
to the source**, which is the part that lets a reader find the original and check the paraphrase.
The form below adds it. All three URLs were checked live on 2026-07-30 and resolve.

**Why paste rather than edit.** The portal now keeps the citation after submit and offers a
*"reuse a citation from a previous run"* picker, so editing the previous string is possible — but
the two things you'd edit are the module number and its exact title, which is precisely where a
typo becomes a permanent provenance error nobody notices. Pasting a prepared row costs the same
and can't drift.

The **Suggest citation** button is the path for journal articles: it reads a DOI off the PDF and
resolves it. The textbook has no DOI, verified — so for these sixteen runs it will correctly tell
you it found none.

A suggestion never fills the field on its own; you accept it explicitly. Attribution is a licence
condition, and a looked-up citation nobody read is worse than one typed badly.

## 7. Before committing 17 hours

Run **one** module, triage it, then fully review two or three of its pages in the reader and time
yourself. Multiply by 78. The ~17-hour estimate predates the reader existing, and rendered pages
with working links should have moved it — better to learn that on run 5 than in week three.

**Run 5 (Module 07, anxiety) is the natural pilot**: it is the next lecture's material, produces 4
Tier A pages plus an overview, and one page in that chapter already has a body, so it exercises the
merge path as well as the create path.
